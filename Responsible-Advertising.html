In the UK, a voluntary coalition called the Conscious Advertising Network (CAN) has been launched to inform businesses of their various responsibilities when advertising and to educate them on best practices. CAN has constructed the topics into 7 manifestos: Anti-Ad Fraud, Diversity, Informed Consent, Hate Speech, Children’s Well-being, Misinformation, and most recently, Sustainability. Although all responsible advertisements must align with these 7 manifestos, the issue with Sustainability has been increasingly apparent as it defines the major challenges of humanity.&nbsp;</div>

            <div class="mbr-text col-12 mbr-fonts-style display-7 col-md-12"><p>The following summarises these areas in which CAN works on:</p><p><strong>Sustainability</strong> - Many consumers today actively expect brands to show how their products, services, and practices affect the environment and show that they are vigilant of the current climate crisis. Businesses should work to ensure that all claims regarding a product’s sustainability and environmental impact are truthful while also considering the impact that advertisements themselves can have.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Anti-Ad Fraud</strong> - Digital ad fraud generally refers to a situation in which an advertisement fails to reach its intended audience or location. This can contribute to the spread of misinformation, online hate speech, less effective advertising, and negative images on a brand’s reputation.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Diversity</strong> - All businesses will be advertising to diverse audiences so it is necessary for businesses to consider what content is included in an advertisement, where they advertise, and how those advertisements are presented to ensure that no one is left out or offended. Furthermore, incorporating a variety of perspectives and backgrounds can be equally as important.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Informed Consent</strong> - Consumers should be aware of everything they may be consenting to when sharing their data with a business. It is the responsibility of a business to provide any necessary information about data collection processes in order to properly educate their consumers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Hate Speech</strong> -  In many cases, irresponsible advertising practices can inadvertently spread hate speech and extremist content which can ostracise customers. By avoiding advertising on media sites that spread extremist views and advocating for media platforms in which they advertise to better monitor hate speech, businesses can play a role in protecting their consumers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Children’s Wellbeing</strong> - Businesses must act responsibly when advertising to children or on websites targeted at children, especially in regard to the types of data that the business may be collecting. By avoiding the collection of personal and behavioural data, businesses can contribute to protecting child privacy.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Misinformation </strong>- Businesses should advertise on credible and reputable sites while also working with advertising agencies that have proven to choose accuracy and fairness over the profit that may come from spreading inaccurate information.</p><div>

            <div class="mbr-text col-12 mbr-fonts-style display-7 col-md-12"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All businesses are exposed to advertising. Responsible businesses must take the role of providing credible information and positive imagery to consumers. Responsible advertising allows businesses to retain customers and create brand recognition while benefiting people, society, businesses, and the economy on a wider scale. All forms of advertising should adhere to ethical traits, as any fraudulent claims can be deemed unethical.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), a competition regulator in the UK, assists businesses to operate within the law and focus on customers purchasing genuine goods and services. Their responsibilities include the investigation of mergers between organisations, anti-competitive behaviour, and ensuring there are no consumer problems.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2021, the CMA developed the Green Claims Code to ensure environmental claims from businesses are indeed genuine and can be substantiated. When businesses make broad claims such as - ‘helping to reduce waste, ‘50% less packaging by 2025’, they must also ask themselves whether they can verify these claims that require additional facts. Many businesses today give a wide variety of claims, specifically environmental claims, yet the evidence of strategy and/or action plans and progress information seem to be unapparent. Businesses participate in greenwashing since the demand for environmentally sound products is high.</p><p> </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, as businesses continue to greenwash, they capitalise on this growing demand and continue to add to global environmental issues. With the launch of the Green Claims Code, CMA gives businesses a framework for checking their environmental claims, and that they are truly green. The Green Claims Code checklist for businesses to ensure their environmental claims is as follows:</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; 1.&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">The claim is accurate and clear for all to understand</span></p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; 2. There’s up-to-date, credible evidence to show that the green claim is true</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; 3. The claim clearly tells the whole story of a product or service; or relates to one part of the product or service without misleading people about the other parts or the overall impact on the environment</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 4. The claim doesn’t contain partially correct or incorrect aspects or conditions that apply</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; 5. Where general claims (eco-friendly, green or sustainable for example) are being made, the claim reflects the whole life cycle of the brand, product, business or service and is justified by the evidence</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; 6. If conditions (or caveats) apply to the claim, they’re clearly set out and can be understood by all</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; 7. The claim won’t mislead customers or other suppliers</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; 8.&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">The claim doesn’t exaggerate its positive environmental impact, or contain anything untrue – whether clearly stated or implied</span></p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; 9. Durability or disposability information is clearly explained and labelled</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; 10. The claim doesn’t miss out or hide information about the environmental impact that people need to make informed choices</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; 11. Information that really can’t fit into the claim can be easily accessed by customers in another way (QR code, website, etc.)</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; 12. Features or benefits that are necessary standard features or legal requirements of that product or service type, aren’t claimed as environmental benefits</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; 13. If a comparison is being used, the basis of it is fair and accurate, and is clear for all to understand</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vague and misleading claims in all aspects are not only unethical but bodies such as the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) or Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) can take action against businesses. Investigations from the International Consumer Protection Enforcement Network (ICPEN), have released data sharing that from the 500 analysed websites promoting clothes, cosmetics, and food, 40% appear to not advertise responsibly, and the information could be misleading and breaking consumer law.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Examples of the 6 other CAN Manifestos:</strong>&nbsp;</p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;"><a href="https://www.consciousadnetwork.com/the-manifestos/dis-misinformation/" class="text-primary">Misinformation</a></span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">The spread of </span><span style="font-size: 1rem; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">misinformation</span><a href="https://www.consciousadnetwork.com/the-manifestos/dis-misinformation/" class="text-primary" style="font-size: 1rem; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"> </a><span style="font-size: 1rem;">online has negatively impacted numerous businesses. Innocent Drinks, a company that produces smoothies and juice, had their advertisements banned by the ASA due to misleading claims. Innocent Drinks had implied purchasing their products would ultimately have a positive environmental impact when this was not the case. Providing transparent information is always important since it increases brand loyalty and customer relationships.</span><br></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;"><a href="https://www.consciousadnetwork.com/the-manifestos/anti-ad-fraud/" class="text-primary">Ad-Fraud</a></span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Coming across advertisements that are not the results of genuine interest can be derived from malware, bots, fake websites, and other cyber-criminal activities.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Ad Fraud is a problem that needs attention from all ad tech ecosystems. In 2016, Trustworthy Accountability Group (TAG) launched its Certified Against Fraud Program to battle invalid traffic in digital advertising. TAG has partnered with industry leaders, aiming to solve issues on malware and fraud advertisements.&nbsp;</span><br></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;"><a href="https://www.consciousadnetwork.com/the-manifestos/diversity/" class="text-primary">Diverse Content</a></span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Consumers are more likely to buy products and services from a company that commits to its core values. It is necessary for businesses to consider what content is being included. For example, having exposure to d</span><span style="font-size: 1rem; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">iverse content</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;"> in advertisements is beneficial to businesses. Advertising at the Super Bowl is considered the largest marketing gig of the year. One of the advertisements consisted of Coca-Cola’s “America is Beautiful” as it featured a patriotic tune, the song was sung in different languages. The advertisement highlighted the multicultural makeup of America as different ethnicities, sexualities, and cultures were shown.</span><br></p><p><em><a href="https://www.consciousadnetwork.com/the-manifestos/informed-consent/" class="text-primary">Informed Consent</a></em></p><p>The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is the world's toughest privacy and security law. GDPR should be viewed as a minimum standard. GDPR allows&nbsp;informed consent to individuals so they can understand how their data is being used and present them with rights of access, the right to object, and the right to data portability. CAN has further stated, “Benchmarks for best practice should be the WFA Data Transparency Manifesto, the Mozilla Data Privacy Principles, and in the comprehensive information available in the ICO checklist for best practices when devising consent strategies.”&nbsp;</p><p><em><a href="https://www.consciousadnetwork.com/the-manifestos/hate-speech/" class="text-primary">Hate Speech</a></em></p><p>Hate Speech has also become a major advertising issue. Pressure group “Stop Funding Hate” has made a commitment to ethical advertising as they aim to make hate unprofitable. They’ve persuaded advertisers to move their advertising budgets away from hateful media. Stop Funding Hate has continued to effectively identify hateful content and discourage media outlets from spreading this message. They do this by following their eight core principles: Telling the truth, prioritising campaigning effectiveness, opposing all forms of hate, being community-driven, supporting all human rights, being non-partisan, committed to positive campaigning, and supporting global co-operation to make hate unprofitable.</p><p><em><a href="https://www.consciousadnetwork.com/the-manifestos/childrens-wellbeing/" class="text-primary">Children's Wellbeing</a></em></p><p>As social responsibility and ethics should be present in advertising, the idea of whether advertising towards children was morally right has been repeatedly asked. Although the UK code of Broadcast Advertising (BCAP Code) applies to all forms of advertisements, they state “children must be protected from advertisements that could cause physical, mental or moral harm.” Advertisements are increasingly targeting children for profit and children's wellbeing must be taken into consideration since issues like childhood obesity which hurts their self-image, increased use of tobacco products, and alcohol usage can become apparent.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anti Ad- Fraud, Diversity, Informed Consent, Hate Speech, Children’s Wellbeing, Misinformation, and Sustainability are issues that are crucial to look at when advertising responsibly. For additional information, please refer to the “Links, News, and Further Research” provided at the bottom of the page to see CAN's explanations for each issue and how to resolve them within your organisation's advertising practices.&nbsp;</p><div>
