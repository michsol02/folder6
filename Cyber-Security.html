The field covers all the processes and mechanisms by which computer-based equipment, information and services are protected from unintended or unauthorised access, change or destruction, and is of growing importance in line with the increasing reliance on computer systems worldwide.</p><p>
</p><div>
</div><div>The Internet has become a crucial part of daily life for individuals and businesses. As such, cyber security is crucial to all businesses, regardless of size or sector. While no organisation is ever 100% secure, cyber security is about taking steps to manage future risks. Without adequate cyber security measures embedded into culture and operations, businesses are taking huge risks. Recent events, such as the WannaCry ransomware attacks, the Equifax breach and the leaking of thousands of personal emails have received global media attention and exemplified the importance of protecting the information that is sensitive both to businesses and their customers.</div><div><br></div><div>
</div><div>'Sensitive information' is data that must be protected from unauthorised access to safeguard the privacy or security of an individual or organisation. There are three types: 
</div><div><br></div><div>&gt;&gt; Personal information -&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">This is any information that can be used for identity theft, as it’s tied to a specific individual.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Examples include National Insurance Numbers, credit card numbers, tax information, and more</span></div><div><br></div><div>&gt;&gt; Business information -&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">This is any information that would have a negative impact on the business if released.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Examples include trade secrets or customer records.</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;"><br></span></div><div>&gt;&gt; Classified information -&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">Small businesses are unlikely to have to worry about classified information, as this is information that is classified as sensitive by the government, and access to it is therefore restricted.</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;"><br></span></div><div>A 'cyber attack' is the attempt by a hacker or hackers to destroy a computer network or system, or destroy, change, or steal the information contained in it. The information that cyber attacks target tends to be the sensitive information, but that is not always the case.
</div><div><br></div><div>A business’s preparedness for a cyber attack, and how it responds in the event of an attack, can have profound impacts up to and including complete organisational failure. The 2022 Information Security Breaches Survey reported that 72% of large firms had experienced a security breach of some sort. An FSB report published in June 2016 notes that 66% of small businesses have been victims of cybercrime, often more than once. Each of these crimes reportedly cost small businesses, on average, nearly £3,000. Given the impact of these breaches, cyber security is not exclusively an issue for large multinationals.</div><div><br></div><div>
</div><div>Businesses of all sizes increasingly hold enormous amounts of customers’ and employees’ private data, including ‘big data’ and ‘metadata’ on members of the public. Such data can be used to establish detailed and accurate profiles of individual behaviour and consumer habits, raising concerns over privacy and data ownership. Despite the significant financial and ethical dangers that accompany cybercrime, there is significant evidence that cyber security is still not treated as a high-priority strategic issue by many businesses.</div><div><br></div><div>
</div><div>Understanding and recognising the evolving landscape of cyber threats at the board level is essential to the sustainability and competitiveness of businesses. Acting on cyber security requires being prepared for and responding to breaches, and concerns intellectual property, customer information, resources, financial data, employee records, and much more. From coffee machines to driverless cars, everything that is linked to a network has the potential to be accessed by ‘hackers’: individuals who attempt to gain unauthorised access to a computer system by exploiting its weaknesses or design flaws.</div><div><br></div><div>
</div><div>This increase in interconnectivity is becoming more prevalent with the ability to collect much more data from more individuals and more sensitive data. The growth of the ‘Internet of Things’ is also a major contributor to the vulnerability that hackers take advantage of. The ‘Internet of Things’ is the interconnection via the Internet of computing devices embedded in everyday objects, enabling them to send and receive data. The security built into all products and services is becoming even more important, as well as that used by companies in their business practices.</div><div>
